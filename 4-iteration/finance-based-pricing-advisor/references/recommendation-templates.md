## Pattern 1: Implement Broadly

**When:** Net revenue impact clearly positive (>10% ARPU lift, <5% churn risk); minimal conversion impact; strong value justification.

**Output:**

"**Implement this pricing change** — Strong financial case

**Revenue Impact:**
- Current MRR: $___
- ARPU lift: ___% ($current → $new)
- Expected MRR increase: +$___/month (+___%)

**Churn Risk: Low**
- Expected churn increase: ___% → ___% (+___% points)
- Churn-driven MRR loss: -$___/month
- **Net MRR impact: +$___/month** ✅

**Conversion Impact:**
- Current conversion: ___%
- Expected conversion: ___% (___% change)
- Impact on new customer acquisition: [minimal / manageable]

**CAC Payback Impact:**
- Current payback: ___ months
- New payback: ___ months (faster due to higher ARPU)

**Why this works:**
[Specific reasoning based on numbers]

**How to implement:**
1. **Grandfather existing customers** (if raising prices)
   - Protect current base from churn
   - New pricing for new customers only
2. **Communicate value**
   - Emphasize features, outcomes, ROI
   - Justify price with value delivered
3. **Monitor metrics (first 30-60 days)**
   - Conversion rate (should stay within ___%)
   - Churn rate (should stay <___%)
   - Customer feedback

**Expected timeline:**
- Month 1: +$___ MRR from new customers
- Month 3: +$___ MRR (cumulative)
- Month 6: +$___ MRR
- Year 1: +$___ ARR

**Success criteria:**
- Conversion rate stays >___%
- Churn rate stays <___%
- NRR improves to >___%"

## Pattern 2: Test First (A/B Test)

**When:** Uncertain impact (wide range between conservative and optimistic); moderate churn or conversion risk; large customer base (can test with subset).

**Output:**

"**Test with a segment before broad rollout** — Impact is uncertain

**Why test:**
- ARPU lift estimate: ___% (wide confidence interval)
- Churn risk: Medium (___% → ___%)
- Conversion impact: Uncertain (___% → ___% estimated)

**Test design:**

**Cohort A (Control):**
- Current pricing: $___
- Size: ___% of new customers (or ___ customers)

**Cohort B (Test):**
- New pricing: $___
- Size: ___% of new customers (or ___ customers)

**Duration:** 60-90 days (need statistical significance)

**Metrics to track:**
- Conversion rate (A vs. B)
- ARPU (A vs. B)
- 30-day retention (A vs. B)
- 90-day churn (A vs. B)
- NRR (A vs. B)

**Decision criteria:**

**Roll out broadly if:**
- Conversion rate (B) >___% of control (A)
- Churn rate (B) <___% higher than control
- Net revenue (B) >___% higher than control

**Don't roll out if:**
- Conversion drops >___%
- Churn increases >___%
- Net revenue impact negative

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Launch test
- Week 8-12: Enough data for statistical significance
- Month 3: Decision to roll out or kill

**Risk:** Medium. Test mitigates risk before broad rollout."

## Pattern 3: Modify Approach

**When:** Original proposal has significant risk; better alternative exists; pricing change needs adjustment to improve outcomes.

**Output:**

"**Modify your approach** — Original proposal has risks

**Original Proposal:**
- [Price increase / New tier / Add-on / etc.]
- Expected ARPU lift: ___%
- Churn risk: High (___% → ___%)
- Net revenue impact: Uncertain or negative

**Problem:**
[Specific issue: e.g., "20% price increase will likely cause 10% churn, wiping out revenue gains"]

**Alternative Approach:**

**Option 1: Smaller price increase**
- Instead of ___% increase, try ___%
- Lower churn risk (___% vs. ___%)
- Still positive net revenue: +$___/month

**Option 2: Grandfather existing, raise for new only**
- Protect current base (zero churn risk)
- Higher prices for new customers only
- Gradual ARPU improvement over time

**Option 3: Value-based pricing (charge more for high-value segments)**
- Keep SMB pricing flat
- Raise enterprise pricing ___%
- Lower churn risk (enterprise is stickier)

**Recommended:**
[Specific option with reasoning]

**Why this is better:**
- Lower churn risk
- Comparable revenue upside
- Easier to communicate

**How to implement:**
[Specific steps for alternative approach]"

## Pattern 4: Don't Change Pricing

**When:** Net revenue impact negative or marginal; high churn risk without offsetting gains; competitive or strategic reasons to hold pricing.

**Output:**

"**Don't change pricing** — Risks outweigh benefits

**Why:**
- Expected revenue lift: +$___/month (___%)
- Expected churn impact: -$___/month (___%)
- **Net revenue impact: -$___/month** 🚨 or marginal

**Problem:**
[Specific issue: e.g., "Churn-driven revenue loss exceeds price increase gains"]

**What would need to change:**

**For price increase to work:**
- Churn rate must stay below ___% (currently ___%)
- OR conversion rate must stay above ___% (currently ___%)
- OR you need to reduce CAC to offset lower conversion

**Alternative strategies:**

**Instead of raising prices:**
1. **Improve retention** — Reduce churn from ___% to ___% (same revenue impact as price increase, lower risk)
2. **Expand within base** — Increase NRR from ___% to ___% via upsells
3. **Reduce CAC** — More efficient acquisition (better than pricing)

**When to revisit pricing:**
- After improving retention (churn <___%)
- After validating willingness-to-pay (WTP research)
- After competitive landscape changes

**Decision:** Hold pricing for now, focus on [retention / expansion / acquisition efficiency]."
