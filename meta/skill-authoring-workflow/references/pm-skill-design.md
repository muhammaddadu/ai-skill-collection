# PM Skill Design — Guided Conversation

Load this reference when the user has a raw idea, notes, or a framework and needs help **shaping it into the right skill structure through conversation** — before running the authoring workflow's generate/validate phases. It defines a 5-question adaptive design session plus the PM-specific skill anatomy the draft must satisfy.

(Absorbed from the retired `pm-skill-creator` skill.)

## PM Skill Anatomy

### The Three Skill Types (Decision Criteria)

- **Component**: One artifact or template. Self-contained. Gets referenced by other skills. Ask: "Is this a thing someone creates?"
- **Interactive**: Guided conversation with adaptive questions and enumerated recommendations. Ask: "Does this require back-and-forth to be useful?"
- **Workflow**: Multi-phase orchestration referencing other skills. Ask: "Does this coordinate multiple activities across steps?"

### Non-Negotiable Sections

Every skill requires these sections in order:
1. **Purpose** — What it does + when to use it (outcome-focused)
2. **Key Concepts** — Frameworks, definitions, mental models
3. **Application** — Step-by-step instructions an agent can follow
4. **Examples** — At least one concrete, specific example
5. **Common Pitfalls** — Named failure modes with consequences and fixes
6. **References** — Related skills, external frameworks, source material

### Metadata Constraints

- `name`: lowercase kebab-case, ≤ 64 characters
- `description`: ≤ 200 characters, must include trigger cue ("Use when...")
- `intent`: longer repo-facing summary (no character limit)
- `type`: one of `component`, `interactive`, `workflow`

### Facilitation Source of Truth

Run the conversation using [`workshop-facilitation`](../../workshop-facilitation/SKILL.md) as the interaction protocol: session heads-up + entry mode (Guided, Context dump, Best guess), one-question turns, progress labels (e.g., Context Q1/5), interruption handling, numbered recommendations at decision points, and quick-select numbered response options (include `Other (specify)` when useful).

## The Design Conversation

This session asks **up to 5 adaptive questions**, then delivers a **complete SKILL.md draft** with frontmatter, all required sections, and repo-compliant structure. Takes about 10-15 minutes.

### Step 0: Session Start

**Agent says:**

"I'll help you design a new PM skill from scratch. This takes about 10-15 minutes and up to 5 questions. How do you want to start?

1. **Guided** — I'll ask questions one at a time and build the skill from your answers (recommended)
2. **Context dump** — Paste your raw content, notes, or framework and I'll propose a skill structure
3. **Best guess** — Tell me just the topic and I'll draft a skill you can refine"

### Question 1: What's the Raw Material? (Q1/5)

**Agent asks:** "What are we turning into a skill? Give me whatever you have."

1. **A framework or mental model** — A structured way of thinking about a PM problem (e.g., prioritization matrix, decision tree)
2. **A template or artifact** — A deliverable PMs create (e.g., PRD section, positioning statement, epic format)
3. **A process or workflow** — A multi-step method for completing a PM task (e.g., discovery sprint, roadmap planning)
4. **A coaching or advisory topic** — A domain where PMs need guided, adaptive help (e.g., stakeholder navigation, pricing decisions)

**Or describe what you have in your own words.**

**Agent note:** If the user pastes raw content instead of choosing an option, analyze the content and infer the answer. Confirm your interpretation before proceeding.

### Question 2: Skill Type Decision (Q2/5)

**Based on Q1's answer, recommend a type and confirm:**

*If Q1 = Framework or Template:*

"This sounds like a **component skill** — a self-contained artifact or reference. It would include a template, quality criteria, and examples. Does that fit, or is there a conversational/adaptive element I'm missing?

1. **Yes, component** — It's a standalone deliverable or reference
2. **Actually, it needs conversation** — Users need guided questions to use it well (→ interactive)
3. **It's bigger than one artifact** — It orchestrates multiple steps or other skills (→ workflow)"

*If Q1 = Process or Workflow:*

"This sounds like a **workflow skill** — a multi-phase process. Does it reference or orchestrate other discrete skills/artifacts, or is it more of a guided conversation?

1. **Yes, workflow** — It has distinct phases and may reference other skills
2. **It's more conversational** — The value comes from adaptive questions and recommendations (→ interactive)
3. **It's simpler than I described** — Really it's one artifact with steps (→ component)"

*If Q1 = Coaching or Advisory:*

"This sounds like an **interactive skill** — guided questions that adapt based on answers, ending with enumerated recommendations. Sound right?

1. **Yes, interactive** — It needs back-and-forth to be useful
2. **It's more of a reference** — Users just need the framework, not a conversation (→ component)
3. **It's a full process** — Multiple phases, orchestrates other skills (→ workflow)"

### Question 3: Scope and Naming (Q3/5)

**Agent asks:**

"What should we call this skill? I need two things:

**a) A working name** — lowercase-kebab-case, max 64 characters (e.g., `feature-investment-advisor`, `user-story`, `discovery-process`)

**b) A one-sentence description** — What it does + when to use it. Must fit in 200 characters and start with a verb or 'Use when...'

Give me your best attempt and I'll tighten it if needed. Or just describe the skill's purpose and I'll propose both."

**Agent note:** Validate the name format (kebab-case, ≤ 64 chars) and description length (≤ 200 chars) before proceeding. If either fails, suggest a fix.

### Question 4: Key Content (Q4/5)

**Adapt to the skill type from Q2:**

*For component skills:*

"What are the core elements of this artifact or framework? I need:
1. **The template or structure** — What sections/fields does it contain?
2. **Quality criteria** — What separates a good one from a bad one?
3. **One concrete example** — A filled-in version showing it done well

Give me whatever you have — bullet points, rough notes, or a full draft."

*For interactive skills:*

"Walk me through the conversation flow:
1. **What's the opening question?** — What does the user need to tell you first?
2. **What are the 2-4 branching paths?** — How do answers change what comes next?
3. **What recommendations emerge?** — What are the 3-5 outcomes you'd offer?

Give me the decision tree as you see it — even if it's rough."

*For workflow skills:*

"Map out the phases:
1. **What are the major steps?** (Usually 3-6 phases)
2. **What's the input and output of each phase?**
3. **Which existing skills does this reference?** (Check with `scripts/find-a-skill.sh --keyword <topic>`)
4. **Where are the decision points?**

Give me the flow — sequential, branching, or both."

### Question 5: Pitfalls and Edge Cases (Q5/5)

**Agent asks:**

"What goes wrong when people do this badly? I need 2-3 failure modes:

1. **Name the failure** — Give it a label (e.g., 'Metrics Theater', 'Hero Syndrome')
2. **Describe the consequence** — What happens when someone falls into this trap?
3. **State the fix** — What's the corrective action?

If you're not sure, tell me the most common mistake you've seen and I'll help structure it."

### Draft Generation

After collecting answers to Q1-Q5, generate a complete SKILL.md draft including:

1. **YAML frontmatter** — `name`, `description`, `intent`, `type`, `best_for`, `scenarios`, `estimated_time`
2. **Purpose** — Synthesized from Q1 + Q3
3. **Key Concepts** — Structured from Q4 content
4. **Application** — Step-by-step instructions derived from Q4
5. **Examples** — Concrete example from Q4 (or generated if not provided)
6. **Common Pitfalls** — Structured from Q5
7. **References** — Related skills identified during conversation + source material

**Agent says after generating:**

"Here's your draft SKILL.md. Before we call it done:

1. **Review the draft** — Does it capture your intent?
2. **Run validation** — `python3 scripts/check-skill-metadata.py skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. **Check triggers** — `python3 scripts/check-skill-triggers.py skills/<name>/SKILL.md --show-cases`
4. **Smoke test** — `./scripts/test-a-skill.sh --skill <name> --smoke`

Want me to adjust anything, or are you ready to validate?"

Then continue with Phases 3-6 of the main workflow (tighten, validate hard, integrate with repo docs, package).

## Examples

### Example: Framework → Component Skill

**Q1:** "1 — A framework. It's a 2x2 matrix for evaluating build-vs-buy decisions."
**Q2:** "1 — Yes, component."
**Q3:** "Name: `build-vs-buy-matrix`. Description: 'Evaluate build-vs-buy decisions using a 2x2 matrix of strategic value and implementation complexity. Use when choosing between building internally and buying a solution.'"
**Q4:** "The axes are strategic differentiation (low/high) and implementation complexity (low/high). Four quadrants: Buy (low/low), Partner (low/high), Build (high/low), Invest (high/high). Quality criteria: each quadrant has a clear decision rule and one example."
**Q5:** "Biggest mistake: treating it as a one-time decision. Consequence: you build something, market shifts, and you're stuck maintaining undifferentiated tech. Fix: revisit quarterly."

**Output:** Complete component skill with template, filled example, and the quarterly-review pitfall.

### Example: Advisory Topic → Interactive Skill

**Q1:** "4 — Coaching topic. Helping PMs navigate their first pricing conversation with leadership."
**Q2:** "1 — Yes, interactive."
**Q3:** "Name: `pricing-conversation-advisor`. Description: 'Prepare for your first pricing conversation with leadership. Use when presenting pricing changes or new monetization to executives.'"
**Q4:** "Opening question: What's the pricing change? Branches: new product pricing, price increase on existing, freemium-to-paid conversion, usage-based transition. Recommendations: data to bring, objection handling, framing strategies."
**Q5:** "Failure mode: 'Leading with the Number.' Consequence: executives fixate on the price point instead of the strategy. Fix: always lead with the business case and customer impact before revealing the number."

**Output:** Complete interactive skill with 3-question flow, 4 branches, and enumerated recommendations per branch.

### Anti-Pattern: Scope Creep

**Q1:** "I want a skill that covers all of product strategy — vision, roadmaps, OKRs, prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and metrics."

**Agent response:** "That's 4-6 separate skills, not one. Let's pick the one that matters most right now and build that. Which piece is most urgent?

1. Vision → component skill
2. Roadmap planning → workflow skill (already exists: `roadmap-planning`)
3. Prioritization → interactive skill (already exists: `prioritization-advisor`)
4. Something else

Start with one. We can build the others after."

## Design-Session Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Type Confusion
**Symptom:** Calling something a "workflow" when it's really a template with numbered steps.
**Consequence:** Over-engineered skill that references non-existent sub-skills and confuses users.
**Fix:** Apply the type decision questions from Q2 honestly. If it doesn't orchestrate other skills or have distinct phases with different inputs/outputs, it's probably a component.

### Pitfall 2: Description That Doesn't Trigger
**Symptom:** Description says what the skill is ("A framework for pricing decisions") but not when to use it.
**Consequence:** Claude can't match user requests to the skill. It sits unused.
**Fix:** Every description must answer "Use when..." — e.g., "Evaluate pricing decisions using a structured framework. Use when choosing between pricing models or preparing a pricing proposal."

### Pitfall 3: Skipping Validation
**Symptom:** "The draft looks good, let's ship it."
**Consequence:** Broken frontmatter, missing sections, failed cross-references, inconsistent catalog counts.
**Fix:** Always run `check-skill-metadata.py` and `check-skill-triggers.py` before considering the skill done. No exceptions.

### Pitfall 4: Kitchen Sink Scope
**Symptom:** Trying to pack an entire domain into one skill.
**Consequence:** A 500-line monster that does nothing well. Too broad to trigger accurately, too long to be useful.
**Fix:** One skill = one job. If you need more than 6 application steps or more than 4 branches, you probably need multiple skills.
